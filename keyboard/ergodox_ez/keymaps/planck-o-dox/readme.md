What?
=====

What's a Planck-o-Dox, you ask?  I'm appropriating the term here, though others have used it before, because it succinctly expresses what I want to build. Not some kind of hybrid physical keyboard, mind you, but a pair of fraternal twins. Two similar keyboards that can be used interchageably with great ease. In short: Their layouts that are nearly identical. Strictly speaking, the smaller subset of Planck keys maps exactly over the larger subset of Ergodox keys. Hence: The Plank-o-Dox layout.

When I'm away from my desk, I can't lug my Ergodox along. It's big, bulky, has two cables, two boards (duh). And I can't use my laptap keyboard. If I'm going to retrain my brain to use this Ergodox thing, what will I do when I need to leave my desk? Tear down, transport and set up when I go to the cafe down the street? No way. Need a small, portable keyboard to keep in my laptop bag. Solution? A lovely Planck keyboard to take along.

The thing is, it is NOT easy to switch back and forth between an ortholinear keyboard and a staggered keyboard. Maybe you have a brain of superior flexibility, but, let me tell you, having retrained my brain to know (and love) an ortholinear keyboard, switching to a staggered keyboard like the one on my laptop makes me want to scream out loud in frustration. Even if I found it less frustrating, there's just no way I would have any kind of speed. Flash: The Planck keyboard! What a perfect excuse to blow some more money on a beautiful new toy. And these keyboards truly *are* pretty! Point at pictures here.


But, just as I find it enormously frustrating to switch from ortholinear to staggered, I would be almost as frustrated switching to another ortholinear with different key placements. Even one or two different keys would be enough to kill my typing speed. What to do? Make the layouts of the two identical. Or, strictly speaking, make the smaller subset of Planck keys map exactly over the larger subset of Ergodox keys. Hence: The Plank-o-Dox.

What I bought... Ergodox Ez and Planck from kkk via MassDrop. Say why I chose these. Prebuilt. I'm a good solder-er, but life is short.


This is my strongly-opinionated Mac OSX Ergodox layout.

I needed something to take my mind off of my anxious waiting for my new ErogoDox Ez to get built and sent to me. I really like what I came up with. Maybe others will find some of this useful, too. You may find the following over-engineered, pedantic, or just plain boring, but I offer it...

Why?
====

I sit for (way too) many hours at my keyboard. I'm a programmer and I text a lot (iMessage for personal and Slack for work).

I'm no spring chicken, as they say. I once told an attractive young programmer that I'd used punched cards, thinking she might be impressed by my über-geekness, and she said something to the effect of: "Oh, you must be really old, then." Not what I was going for...

Original: Posture and split is what I need for that.
A second major concern was reducing stress and strain on my hands. This accounts for my remapping of symbols and of the shift keys, in opposition to being "standard".
Wanted a mechanical keyswitch keyboard
Fun.


How?
====

Approached this as a constraint problem and arrived at an optimal-ish solution by successive approximation —iteration that spirals in to a stable optimal point on the graph.

reprogram with tmk/qmk explain for those who do not know. How to do this, is out of scope. Look here...


Given that I intended to make changes to the standard placements of keys...

Hierarchy of brain parts for mnemonics: 

1. Brain stem, "muscle memory". We are touch-typists after all, right? I claim that the brain stem is highly symmetical. Primitive bilateral symmetry of our body plans. When there is a need to have keys on both sides of the keyboard, or to move a standard set of keys from one side to the other, they should be mirrored, or flipped over a vertical axis. The proof I offer comes from my own experience: I learned to do clipboard keys on both sides. It was much easier. Explain why and what this led to in my choices. Annoying exceptions: The command/gui and return keys. The main thumb buttons, but cross your eyes.
2. Verbal/language.  You could make a case for second place for the visual cortex, but I'm a programmer, which is a linguistic occupation. It also seems like an inevitable layer of indirection that you can't let go of that hinders transition to muscle memory. Using the visual memory to remember which key to hit is equivalent to "looking at the keyboard" to type, even if you are only consulting a mental image in your head and not actually looking down.
3. Visual cortex


Tried to justify most decisions. My philosophies:

- Keep it simple. Keep a clear conceptual separation between difference classes of characters and operations.
- Keep it familiar until there's a compelling reason to depart from a standard.
- Break symmetry only when there's a good reason. The brain stem is symmetrical. Evidence, using same finger on the two sides for clipboard operations works so well, for me at least. This, in spite of the fact that it contravenes what my visual cortex would prefer —seeing a picture of the numeric keypad, for example
- Have just one way to type a given character. Only one thing to memorize.

TMK lets you overload character keys as modifiers. That means that a tap types the character, and a press-and-hold gives you a modifier of your choice. This lets you have modifiers right on the home row (or anywhere else). This sounds great, but in practice just it feels wrong. When my lovely Gateron Blue keyswitches go "click", I want to see the character appear on my screen at that same instant (the X ms delay between the "actuation point" and making electrical contact, not withstanding). When you overload a key, however, you'll see the character appear only on the *release* of the key. This displeases me and I can't abide it.

My layer-by-layer exposition. At first glace you may not like what you see. Bear with me as I justify each and every key.

add: Everything out side of the Planck keys on the Ergodox are "convenience keys". They are not essential and there is always another way to get at the same functionality on another layer, or by typing a sequence of keys.

    I suppose a "true" pod would be split, or splittable, too. Someday…
    

Orthogonal to all this is an innovation: My modifier patch. I think this is the best. I think all modifier keys in the world should work like this.

Retraining. The mosrt hardest thing was the damn "c" key, followed by the "b". Recommend keeping the xxx key unbound until you complete
Reccommend leaving the xxx unbound until you get used to Ergodox. Or you'll be hitting it insted of "b" and doing soemtning you didnt want. better to do niothing insted of cleaning uo.

What Needs Improvement

As you will realize by reviewing my text above, I have an all-too-something desire (there I go again) to use dashes in my prose. I use them tons in my code as well. I've moved them from the top row to the home row in my current layout, but they're on my symbols layer. I've traded the long reach on the standard keyboard for a single-shot tap and home row hit. Sigh. I want to find a way to keep it on the base layer, but where would I put it?
