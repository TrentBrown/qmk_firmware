This is my strongly-opinionated Mac OSX Ergodox layout.

I needed something to take my mind off of my anxious waiting for my new ErogoDox Ez to get built and sent to me. I really like what I came up with. Maybe others will find some of this useful, too.

I sit for (way too) many hours at my keyboard. I'm a programmer and I text a lot (iMessage for personal and Slack for work)

Tried to justify most decisions. My philosophies:

- Keep it simple. Keep a clear conceptual separation between difference classes of characters and operations.
- Keep it familiar until there's a compelling reason to depart from a standard.
- Break symmetry only when there's a good reason.
- Have just one way to type a given character. Only one thing to memorize.

TMK lets you overload character keys as modifiers. That means that a tap types the character, and a press-and-hold gives you a modifier of your choice. This lets you have modifiers right on the home row (or anywhere else). This sounds great, but in practice just it feels wrong. When my lovely Gateron Blue keyswitches go "click", I want to see the character appear on my screen at that same instant (the X ms delay between the "actuation point" and making electrical contact, not withstanding). When you overload a key, however, you'll see the character appear only on the *release* of the key. This displeases me and I can't abide it.

My layer-by-layer exposition. At first glace you may not like what you see. Bear with me as I justify each and every key.

add: Everything out side of the Planck keys on the Ergodox are "convenience keys". They are not essential and there is always another way to get at the same functionality on another layer, or by typing a sequence of keys.


Other uses of the term "Planck-o-dox":

    I suppose a "true" pod would be split, or splittable, too. Somedayâ€¦
    

Orthogonal to all this is an innovation: My modifier patch. I think this is the best. I think all modifier keys in the world should work like this.

Retraining. The mosrt hardest thing was the damn "c" key, followed by the "b". Recommend keeping the xxx key unbound until you complete
Reccommend leaving the xxx unbound until you get used to Ergodox. Or you'll be hitting it insted of "b" and doing soemtning you didnt want. better to do niothing insted of cleaning uo.

As you will realize by reviewing my text above, I have an all-too-something desire (there I go again) to use dashes in my prose. I use them tons in my code as well. I've moved them from the top row to the home row in my current layout, but they're on my symbols layer. I've traded the long reach on the standard keyboard for a single-shot tap and home row hit. Sigh. I want to find a way to keep it on the base layer, but where would I put it?
